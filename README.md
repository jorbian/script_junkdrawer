I love scripting! It offers the kind of 'instant' gratification few other forms of software development
can ever match. Obviously, when we can, we should try to solve problems in the most robust way we can,
but sometimes we only have the afternoon and need to settle for the first answer we find.

This repo isn't so much a professional portfolio as it is a scrapbook -- or as the name implies --
a junkdrawer, that's here for my reference as much as anybody elses. I may or may not be actively
maintaining any particular script here, but I have made every effort to make sure they are self
contained and will run 'out of the box' -- if at all possible -- in their respective languages.
